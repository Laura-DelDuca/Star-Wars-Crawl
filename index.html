              It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a
              hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil
              Galactic Empire.
              <br />
              <br />

              During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to
              the Empire’s ultimate weapon, the DEATH STAR, an armored space
              station with enough power to destroy an entire planet.

              <br />
              <br />
              Pursued by the Empire’s sinister agents, Princess Leia races home
              aboard her starship, custodian of the stolen plans that can save
              her people and restore freedom to the galaxy…
